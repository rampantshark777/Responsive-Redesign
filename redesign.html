<h1>About Our Authentic Indian Cuisine</h1>
<img src="maharani2.jpg" alt="No image available" class="foodPicture">
<p>
    We opened in Charlotte in June of 2002. The restaurant is located at 901 South Kings Drive. Maharani (meaning “queen”) is the perfect fit for the Queen City. Its owner, Amandeep Singh, is a New Delhi native and along with his wife, Manjeet, in her authentic sari attire, make this family the most cordial of hosts. Maharani offers an array of traditional Indian cuisine with every dish presented uniquely infused with its own precise blend of spices. The 16th century founders of this North Indian cuisine were lovers of nature and good life, and had a keen sense of beauty and a passion for elegance. These qualities are most definitely reflected in Maharani’s presentation of food, and in every other contribution Amandeep and his crew prepare. This restaurant, adorned with ceremonial art, offers humble hospitality and delectable dining.
